### Downloading R

During this first week I installed R/Rstudio and learned about packages such as tidyverse. I read a chapter from "Getting Started with R and Rstudio" as well as "Modern Drive"

After learning how to install packages I loaded them for the first time.

```{r cars}
# load packages ----

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)

```

I then learned to read data

```{r}
# read in data ----------

beaches <- read_csv(here("data1", "sydneybeaches.csv"))

```

Similar process with Modern Drive

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(knitr)
library(moderndive)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(fivethirtyeight)

# read in Data ----

View(airlines)
View(flights)
View(alaska_flights)
glimpse(flights)
kable(airlines)
airlines$name
glimpse(airports)
?flights


```
